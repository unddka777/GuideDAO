      <h2 id="Intro">Who Is Banksy?</h2>
      <p>
        Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist
        and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and
        the subject of speculation. Active since the 1990s, his satirical street
        art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed
        in a distinctive stenciling technique. His works of political and social
        commentary have appeared on streets, walls and bridges throughout the
        world.

      <p>
        During his early years, Banksy was anonymous for fear of being
        prosecuted for the criminal damage inflicted by his street art.
        Nowadays, he continues to paint covertly to dodge the limelight and
        protect that air of mystery so distinctive to graffiti artists. There
        are many theories surrounding the identity of Banksy, but the most
        prominent one suggests that the artist is a man by the name of Robin
        Gunningham. Gunningham was born in 1973 in Yate, just outside of
        Bristol, and many former schoolmates say they believe him to be Banksy.
