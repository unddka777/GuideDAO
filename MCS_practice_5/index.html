                The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well
                suited to all communal living spaces and bedrooms. Consisting of
                a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular
                shapes, Meta’s appearance changes from delicate and thin, to
                substantial and full depending on the viewing angle. Featuring
                multi-directional storage for your reading material and an even
                top for decorative accessories.

                Click Shelf Click is a boltless shelving system. The
                minimalistic form and construction, as well as the visual
                lightness, form the aesthetic characteristics of the shelf.
                Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel, a girder and shelves, the
                system functions similar to a construction kit. Only four screws
                fix the girder together to which the shelves are simply hung up
                without any tools. The material and precision of the components
                guarantee the stability and assembly.

                Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open
                to diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side
                table, bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine
                collection, serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding
                small personal essentials as a hallway tray. The Float Shelf
                equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique
                accommodation and boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most
                elegant degree, the strict geometry of this wall-mounted shelf
                lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of
                two offset levels cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with a
                simple two-fold composition allowing for flexible placement, use
                and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles of
                modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the
                essence of a shelf.
